# Newtonian Potential Simulator

This is my first desktop application, as well as the first Python program I've made that has a GUI (created using Python's default Tkinter package). This program enables the user to select values for mass, speed of light, gravitational constant, and a custom point that is a select distance, then creates an interactive 3D graph of the Newtonian Potential for a Schwarzschild Black Hole with those values. It determines the Schwarzschild radius of the black hole, alongside determining the time dilation, escape velocity, and gravitational redshift at the user's chosen point.

The application is fairly customisable, with options to vary the colour of the graph, units of the axis, scale size and scale sensitivity, as well as providing an option to download any graphs produced.

It's taken me a while to get it fully functional, and is probably my most advanced program I've yet made due to the complications of setting up a GUI and converting it into a .exe application. If you want to download the desktop application itself please click [HERE](https://github.com/john-ray-uk/Newtonian-Potential-Simulator/releases/download/v1.0.0/Newtonian.Potential.Simulator.exe).

Please note that the application is **ONLY functional on Windows devices** and is **~285MB** in size.
